### Disclaimer
  
AIBot is a hobby project and should be treated as such. This project is intended for learning purposes only, but I acknowledge the possibility that this project can be used for malicious purposes such as to gain an unfair advantage in multiplayer shooter games. I do not condone video game cheating in any regard. If you are using AIBot to cheat, consider reading the following disclaimer.  
  
Cheating in video games often stems from deeper psychological needs, such as low self-esteem and a desire for control. If you find yourself resorting to cheats, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on why.  

Cheating can provide a temporary sense of control and accomplishment, but it ultimately undermines your genuine self-worth. True satisfaction comes from overcoming challenges and developing skills through honest effort.  

Overcoming cheating habits may require addressing underlying psychological issues. Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you develop healthier coping mechanisms and cultivate a more positive gaming experience.
